% tells MATLAB to assume that all of these variables are real-valued (as
% opposed to compled-valued, for example).

% For convenience, define the position (a point), the linear velocity (a
% vector), and the angular velocity (a vector) in coordinates, in terms of
% the state variables. Note that we do NOT group the yaw, pitch, and roll
% angles into a 3x1 matrix, to emphasize that these angles are NOT the
% coordinates of any point or vector.

% For convenience, define the set of all states as a 12x1 matrix "x". The
% order in which we choose to list the states is up to us - we just need to
% be consistent everywhere else.

% For convenience, define the set of all inputs as a 4x1 matrix "u".

% Find equations of motion in symbolic form. This is a 12x1 matrix h, each
% entry of which is a function of symbolic states and inputs. In our notes
% from class, we would write:

%   xdot = h(x, u)
%
h = [v;
     GetN_ZYX(hy, hp, hr) * w;
     (1 / m) * f;
     inv(J) * (tau - wedge(w) * J * w)];

% Restrict everything to vertical motion on a line.
% - We only need two EOMs, one corresponding to pitch angle and the other
%   corresponding to pitch angular velocity. These are the 5th and 11th EOM.

% - All states and inputs are zero except for hp, w2, and u2.

% - The only remaining states are hp, w2. The only remaining input is u2.
x = x([5, 11]);
u = u(2);

% Find equations of motion in numeric form. This is a MATLAB function h_num
% that can called like any other function as h_num(x, u), with real-valued
% arguments x (a 12x1 matrix of numbers) and u (a 4x1 matrix of numbers).
